# Fishermans-banking web-app

## Intro

This was a little Project I did to gain a deeper understanding of full-stack development. 
It simulates a banking application in which you can send and recieve money and check your transaction-statistics.
This originally was a project created locally and then dumped on github.
Now I've made a couple modifications so that I can deploy it.

## Deployment 

The Frontend, which is built with angular is automatically deployed on netlify.
The Backend, that i built with node.js is deployed on Render.

### Demo

The Demo of the application can be tested here: https://fishermansbanking.netlify.app

## Usage

In this application one can create a User and then use the banking system with all its functions.

### Pages

#### /login

Here you can login if you have already registered with my application.

#### /register

Here you can register a user with my application and after completion use my programm.

#### /home/dashboard

Here you can create a transaction and also view all your previous transactions.

#### /home/e-cockpit

Here you can also see you transactions but much more detailed.
You can see a lot of statictics like you spending by category, your overall balance history or manage your budget.
